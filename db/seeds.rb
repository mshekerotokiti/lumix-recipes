          instruction: "Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.\nPut the biscuits in a large re-sealable freezer bag and bash with a rolling pin into fine crumbs. Melt the butter in a small pan, then add the biscuit crumbs and stir until coated with butter. Tip into the tart tin and, using the back of a spoon, press over the base and sides of the tin to give an even layer. Chill in the fridge while you make the filling.\nCream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. You can do this in a food processor if you have one. Process for 2-3 minutes. Mix in the eggs, then add the ground almonds and almond extract and blend until well combined.\nPeel the apples, and cut thin slices of apple. Do this at the last minute to prevent the apple going brown. Arrange the slices over the biscuit base. Spread the frangipane filling evenly on top. Level the surface and sprinkle with the flaked almonds.\nBake for 20-25 minutes until golden-brown and set.\nRemove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the sides of the tin. An easy way to do this is to stand the tin on a can of beans and push down gently on the edges of the tin.\nTransfer the tart, with the tin base attached, to a serving plate. Serve warm with cream, cr√®me fraiche or ice cream.",

          instruction: "Take a large pot or wok, big enough to cook all the chicken, and heat the oil in it.
          Once the oil is hot, add sliced onion and fry them until deep golden brown.
          Then take them out on a plate and set aside.
          To the same pot, add the chopped garlic and saut√© for a minute.
          Then add the chopped tomatoes and cook until tomatoes turn soft.
          This would take about 5 minutes.
          Then return the fried onion to the pot and stir.
          Add ginger paste and saut√© well.
          Now add the cumin seeds, half of the coriander seeds and chopped green chillies.
          Give them a quick stir.
          Next goes in the spices ‚Äì turmeric powder and red chilli powder.
          Saut√© the spices well for couple of minutes.
          Add the chicken pieces to the wok, season it with salt to taste and cook the chicken covered on medium-low heat until the chicken is almost cooked through.
          This would take about 15 minutes.
          Slowly saut√©ing the chicken will enhance the flavor, so do not expedite this step by putting it on high heat.
          When the oil separates from the spices, add the beaten yogurt keeping the heat on lowest so that the yogurt doesn‚Äôt split.
          Sprinkle the remaining coriander seeds and add half of the dried fenugreek leaves.
          Mix well.
          Finally add the cream and give a final mix to combine everything well.
          Sprinkle the remaining kasuri methi and garam masala and serve the chicken handi hot with naan or rotis.
          Enjoy!",

Add water or oil 1 tablespoon at a time if the paste becomes too dry. Don't burn the paste.

It will go away when roasting.\nWhen the marinade/sauce has cooled, pour everything over the chicken and marinate overnight to two days.\nPreheat the oven to 425 F.\nRemove the chicken from the marinade. Spoon the marinade onto a greased (or aluminum lined) baking sheet. Lay the chicken on top of the sauce (make sure the chicken covers the sauce and the sauce isn't exposed or it'll burn) and spread the remaining marinade on the chicken. Roast for 35-45 minutes or until internal temp of the thickest part of chicken is at least 175 F.\nLet chicken rest for 5 minutes. Brush the chicken with some of the oil. Serve chicken with the sauce over steamed rice (or coconut rice).",

                You can now throw in more chillies if it‚Äôs not spicy enough for you.
                If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar until the mixture tastes well balanced.
                Make a few slashes in the chicken thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices.
                Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.
                If you want to barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you‚Äôre ready to cook.
                Authentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled.
                To get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30 mins.
                To cook in the oven, heat to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

                Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney beans.
                Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat.
                Once the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for 10 mins.
                Add the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid.
                Leave off the heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed.
                Squeeze the roasted lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if you like it really spicy.",
